# Introduction

## Motivation

We have a microservice infrastructure and need cross-service transactions. One way to do it is to send a graphql query + variables to one service and perform a query there. So this library helps to send more standardized data via JS Objects. If you know a better way to solve this problem, you are welcome to issues or email.
